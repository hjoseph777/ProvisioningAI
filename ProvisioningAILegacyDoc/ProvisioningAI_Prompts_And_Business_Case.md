## Prompts, Architecture & Business Case

## PART 1 — The Problem We Are Solving

---

### The Current Reality — Triple Entry

Every M-Files implementation follows the same painful sequence. The same information is written, drawn, and re-entered multiple times by hand. Nothing is automated. Nothing is reused.

```
Step 1 — Consultant reads the client SOW
         (Word document, email, PDF)

Step 2 — Consultant opens Cacoo
         Manually draws the workflow diagram
         State boxes drawn one by one
         Arrows drawn one by one
         ← Same information as the SOW

Step 3 — Consultant opens M-Files Admin
         Manually redraws the same diagram
         Clicks through every state
         Clicks through every transition
         Configures every permission
         ← Same information again

Step 4 — Consultant writes the PRD
         Documents what was just built
         ← Same information again

Step 5 — Consultant manually tests 30+ scenarios
         One by one, logged in as each user
         ← Verifying what was already in the SOW

Step 6 — Consultant writes the compliance report
         Documents what the tests proved
         ← Same information again
```

**The same information — users, workflow states, transitions, permissions, rules — is written six times. Every re-entry is an opportunity for error. Every error means rework.**

---

### The Time Cost

| Task | Manual time | With ProvisioningAI |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Draw workflow in Cacoo | 45–90 min | 0 min |
| Build workflow in M-Files Admin | 2–3 hours | 0 min |
| Configure permissions and conditions | 1–2 hours | 0 min |
| Manual test execution (30+ cases) | 4–6 hours | 3 min |
| Write compliance report | 1–2 hours | 10 sec |
| **Total per implementation** | **8–14 hours** | **~15 min** |

**Per project savings: 8 to 14 hours. Per consultant per year: hundreds of hours.**

---

### The Template Reuse Problem

Some consultants attempt to save time by copying a vault from a previous project. This creates a different problem. Workflows inherited from a previous client carry decisions that no longer apply. Conditions exist because a different client needed them. States are named for a different business process. The result is vaults that work but that nobody fully understands — complex without reason, fragile under change.

**Template reuse does not solve the problem. It transfers it.**

---

### The Solution — ProvisioningAI

ProvisioningAI reads the SOW once and generates everything downstream automatically.

```
                    SOW
              (single source of truth)
                     │
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐
        │            │            │
        ▼            ▼            ▼
   Diagram       workflow      PRD
  (Mermaid)       .json      (.md)
  auto-drawn   auto-built   auto-written
                     │
                     ▼
              M-Files Vault
              (COM API)
              workflow already drawn
              just add conditions
```

**One input. Everything else is automatic.**

The consultant chooses how to provide the SOW — three paths, all producing the same result:

| Input method | Best for |
| :--- | :--- |
| ◈ NLP | Structured Markdown SOW — offline, free, instant |
| ✦ AI Extract | Any raw SOW format — paste Word, email, PDF text |
| ⬡ Cacoo Import | Team already has Cacoo diagram — pull via API |

---

## PART 2 — The Three Prompts

---

### Prompt 1 — ◈ NLP (Markdown + spaCy + regex)

**What it is:** The local parsing pipeline. No API. No internet. No cost. Runs entirely on the consultant's machine.

**Three engines working together:**

```
markdown-it-py    → understands document structure
                    tables, headings, lists, paragraphs

regex             → extracts structured data from tables
                    | State Name | Initial |
                    → { name: "Draft", initial: true }
                    100% accuracy

spaCy             → reads English prose sentences
en_core_web_sm      "Only Contract Managers can create..."
12 MB model         → { permission: "Contract Managers",
                        action: "create" }
                    80–90% accuracy
```

### Prompt 2 — ✦ AI Extract (Claude API)

**What it is:** The consultant pastes any raw SOW — Word text, email, PDF paste, any language, any format. Claude extracts everything and populates the spreadsheet.

**The system prompt (sent to Claude API):**

```python
# provisioningai/prompts/claude_extract.py
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# PROVISIONINGAI AI EXTRACTION PROMPT
# Sent to Claude API with the raw SOW text
# Returns structured workflow.json
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────

CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are ProvisioningAI — an intelligent extraction engine for
Document Management System implementations.

Your job is to read a Statement of Work (SOW) and extract
ALL implementation requirements into a structured JSON format.

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact schema.
No explanation. No preamble. No markdown code fences.
Start your response with { and end with }.

{
  "name": "project or workflow name",
  "description": "one sentence overview",
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "full name",
      "role": "job title",
      "email": "email if provided, empty string if not",
      "isCM": true or false,
      "groups": ["group name 1", "group name 2"]
    }
  ],
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "exact state name as written",
      "initial": true or false,
      "description": "brief description if provided"
    }
  ],
  "transitions": [
    {
      "from": "exact from state name",
      "to": "exact to state name",
      "condition": "condition text or empty string",
      "permission": "authorized group or Automatic"
    }
  ],
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "field name",
      "type": "Text or Integer or Decimal or Date or Lookup or Boolean",
      "required": true or false
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    "plain English rule — one complete sentence per rule"
  ]
}

## Extraction Rules — follow strictly

1. NEVER invent requirements not stated in the document
2. NEVER assume users, states, or rules that are not written
3. If a field is not mentioned — use empty string or empty array
4. Extract state names EXACTLY as written — preserve capitalisation
5. For threshold conditions, extract the operator and value:
   "exceeding €50,000" → "Contract Value > 50000"
   "below fifty thousand" → "Contract Value < 50000"
6. For automatic transitions (time-based, event-based):
   set permission to "Automatic"
7. For users — isCM is true only if explicitly identified as
   Contract Manager or given explicit create/edit rights
8. If the document is in French — extract and translate to English
9. For ambiguous rules — include them verbatim in the rules array
10. Rules about permissions go in rules array AND in the relevant
    transition permission field

## Quality Check

Before returning JSON, verify:
- Every transition references states that exist in the states array
- Every user group referenced in transitions exists in user groups
- Initial state is set on exactly one state (the starting point)
- No duplicate state names
- No duplicate transition pairs (same from + same to)

### Prompt 3 — ⬡ Cacoo Import

## PART 3 — JSON Review Before Ingestion

Before any COM API call is made, ProvisioningAI writes `workflow.json` to disk. The consultant reviews it directly in the app or in any text editor. This is the verification gate.

**Why this matters:**

Business rules, roles, and permissions are complex. Before instructing the COM API to create these entities in a live vault, the consultant must confirm the JSON is correct. Ingesting wrong permissions to a production vault is difficult to reverse.

**The review workflow:**

```
Spreadsheet populated (NLP / AI / Cacoo)
        │
        ▼
[Save JSON] → writes workflow.json to disk
        │
        ▼
Consultant opens JSON viewer in ProvisioningAI
Reviews every section:
  ✓ states — correct names and initial flag
  ✓ transitions — correct from/to pairs
  ✓ users — correct roles and groups
  ✓ properties — correct types
  ✓ rules — correct rule text
        │
        ▼
[Approve] — unlocks Ingest button
        │
        ▼
COM API ingests to M-Files vault
```

**The JSON schema (what the consultant reviews):**

## PART 4 — The M-Files COM API Library

**What exists — confirmed from GitHub research:**

| Library | Source | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `python-mfiles` | github.com/afcmrp/python-mfiles | Python wrapper around M-Files API — search, upload, download, create objects |
| `pywin32` | github.com/mhammond/pywin32 | Raw Windows COM access — full M-Files admin operations |
| `MFilesSamplesAndLibraries` | github.com/M-Files | Official M-Files C# samples and libraries |

**For ProvisioningAI — recommendation:**

```
Phase 1 POC:    pywin32 (raw COM)
                Full admin access
                AddWorkflowAdmin confirmed working
                No abstraction layer needed for POC

Phase 1+:       python-mfiles as helper
                Wraps common operations cleanly
                pip install mfiles
                Useful for object operations
                Not needed for workflow creation

Phase 2:        pywin32 for conditions/permissions
                python-mfiles for testing assertions
                Best of both
```

**Install both:**

```bash
pip install pywin32
pip install mfiles
```
